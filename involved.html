                <h3>Step 1: Changing Your Thoughts</h3>
                <p>Observe your negative triggers. 
                    Do your negative thoughts start after you weigh yourself? 
                    Or after talking to someone who is negative about their body? 
                    Do negative thoughts start after reading a magazine or watching 
                    celebrities on television? Keep track of when you feel bad about your body.
                    As you begin to recognize when your body image is low, 
                    learn to avoid certain activities that you know may trigger 
                    feeling bad about your body, and make friends that will assure you that y
                    ou're not whatever you think you are
                </p>
                <p>
                    Accept people of all body shapes. 
                    Turn your attention to accepting people 
                    of all body shapes and sizes. 
                    This can help turn the focus away 
                    from you and onto other people and help 
                    you to appreciate your own body. Remember 
                    that the perception of beauty has changed 
                    significantly throughout time and varies 
                    from culture to culture. In some cultures, h
                    aving extra weight is a sign of wealth and beauty, 
                    while others value long necks, small feet, etc. 
                    The “ideal beauty” Marilyn Monroe was a size 14.
                    Write down a list of people you admire that don’t 
                    have “perfect” bodies. Do their bodies detract from your respect for them?
                </p>
                <p>
                    Combat negative thoughts about your body. 
                    If you have a voice inside you that says that 
                    your body is bad or that there's something wrong 
                    with you or your body, begin to acknowledge that 
                    voice and then challenge it. If you notice yourself 
                    having negative thoughts about your body, begin to 
                    replace the thoughts with more positives ones.
                    Focus on feeling neutral towards your body as an initial 
                    goal and then work on developing more positive feelings about yourself.
                    Use positive affirmations to help combat your negative thoughts. 
                    For example, if you think, “My body is hideous and no one will ever love me,” 
                    replace that thought with, “I am worthy of love for who I am as a person.” 
                    For more positive affirmations, check out How to Use Affirmations Effectively.
                    You can also try giving yourself a compliment about your physical 
                    appearance every day to help improve your body image. Look in the mirror 
                    and find one aspect of your physical appearance that you like 
                    and compliment yourself out loud. For example, you can say, 
                    "My eyes are a beautiful shade of green with this sweater on," or, 
                    "I love how thick and curly my hair is," or "I love how strong my legs look."
                    Consider whether the thought is something you would say to a best friend or sister. 
                    If not, then try to turn the thought into something kinder.
                </p>

                    Find peace with your genetics. 
                    Many parts of your body are from genetics and cannot be changed. 
                    Instead of resenting the fact that you cannot change some aspect 
                    of your body (like feeling scrawny or too tall), work to change your 
                    beliefs about yourself. Focus on keeping your body healthy and not 
                    on keeping it a certain size or shape. Accept the body you were given 
                    by accepting the genetics you have.
                    Don’t compare your body with friends, family, or celebrities. 
                    Your body is unique and it is yours.
                    While you may not like a certain body part, see if it provides you any advantages. 
                    For example, if you have broad shoulders, you may be a great swimmer or naturally 
                    strong in your upper body.

                <h3>Step 2: Handling Emotional Triggers</h3>
                <p>
                    Practice self-compassion. If you have a negative body image, 
                    then practicing self-compassion on a regular basis can help. 
                   There are many ways that you can be more compassionate to yourself, such as:
                    Writing a letter to yourself from the perspective of a friend who loves you unconditionally.
                     In the letter, say things that someone who has limitless love for you might say to build 
                     yourself up. For example, you might start with something like, “I know that you are struggling with body image right now, 
                     but I want you to know that I love you no matter what. I love you because…”
                    Keeping a journal to provide comfort for yourself. There might be days when lots of little 
                    things get to you or when everything seems to be wrong. When this happens, try recording your 
                    experiences in a journal and then be compassionate towards yourself in response. For example, 
                    after describing a rough day at work, you might tell yourself, “I am sorry you had such a hard day. 
                    I think that it might be a good idea for you to take a long relaxing bath and then read a chapter 
                    in your favorite book to help yourself feel a little better.”
                    Reminding yourself that this is temporary. When you are having a rough time, 
                    it can also help to reassure yourself out loud. Try saying something to yourself like, 
                    “I am hurting right now. Many people experience the same emotions. What can I do to help 
                    myself feel better?
                </p>
                <p>
                    Get real with your emotions. If you don't know how to deal with your feelings, 
                    you may turn to your body and start blaming your body for how you feel. Yet, by saying, 
                    “I feel fat” or, “I wish I looked more feminine” or, “I'm too short,” you're more likely 
                    saying, “There's something about me or the way I feel that is wrong.” When you begin to 
                    feel more comfortable with your emotions, you may become more comfortable about your body.
                    Think about what emotions fuel your negative body image. 
                    Are you ashamed, sad, or angry? Are there other places in your life you feel ashamed, 
                    sad, or angry that you might not acknowledge?
                </p>
                <p>
                    Talk to a therapist. Left untreated, negative body image can lead 
                    to low self-esteem and an eating disorder such as anorexia or bulimia. 
                    If you're struggling with negative body image or if it is interfering 
                    with your daily life, seek professional help, such as by talking to a therapist. 
                    Your therapist can help you work through your emotions and bring clarity to them.
                    Cognitive behavior therapy (CBT) helps you restructure your negative thoughts to 
                    more rational and positive thought patterns.
                    Your therapist may guide you to acknowledge your 
                    feelings and sensations to feel more comfortable in your own body. 
                    The therapist may help you express feelings you typically suppress.
                </p>
                <p>
                    Avoid falling into diet traps. If you think that dieting will 
                    fix your negative body image, think again. Body image has little 
                    do with your body and more about how you feel in your body. 
                    You may diet to your “ideal weight” and still feel bad about yourself 
                    and your body. Dieting can cause mood swings, bingeing behavior, 
                    low self-confidence, and hopelessness.
                    If losing weight feels like the only way out, recognize that it's 
                    up to you to change your perception of your body. While you may change 
                    the way you look, you may not change the way you feel.
                    This is the truth of any activity that can modify your body, 
                    such as weight lifting to gain more muscle. 
                    Having muscles may make you look different, but it doesn't mean you'll feel d
                    ifferent about yourself.

                <h3>Step 3: Supporting a Healthy Body Image</h3>
                <p>
                    Appreciate what your body does for you. Instead of focusing on 
                    your dissatisfaction with your body, focus on what your body 
                    does for you every day. For example, perhaps your body can run, 
                    skip, twirl, or dance. Your body breathes for you every moment without 
                    you having to think about it. Laughing and dreaming are also ways your 
                    body gives back to you. Practice mindfulness to really get into your body. 
                    First, sit comfortably, relax, and focus on your exhales and inhales. 
                    Then, begin to feel the sensations in your body. 
                    Notice how your muscles feel throughout your body, what temperatures you experience, 
                    and how the chair or floor feels against you. 
                    Tune into pleasant and unpleasant sensations and observe them.[

                <p>Wear clothes you enjoy. If you're constantly hiding behind clothes that don't 
                    fit and you feel unattractive in, it may be difficult to change your perception of yourself. 
                    Wear clothes that feel comfortable to you and that make you feel good about your body. 
                    Start to work with your body and not against it.
                    Clothes don't have to be about your body. Wear clothes that you enjoy, 
                    feel comfortable in, and that express who you are as a person, not as a body.
                </p>
                <p>
                    Surround yourself with support. Have people in your life that love and support you 
                    for who you are. Be near people who are body positive and stay away from people 
                    who constantly talk down about themselves. By surrounding yourself with positive 
                    and loving people, you can better approach yourself more lovingly and positively.
                    Take a break from friends who talk down about themselves and be near people who uplift you. 
                    Say, “I'm focusing on feeling better about myself and my body, and I need people in my life 
                    who feel good about their bodies.”
                </p>
                <p>
                    Do something nice for your body. Find ways to treat your body nicely. 
                    Go for a walk, take a bubble bath, or get a massage. See how it feels to treat 
                    your body well and what feelings you have afterward.
                    Pay attention to the sensations in your body or any states of relaxation 
                    within your body and mind. Does having your body relaxed help your mind to relax?
